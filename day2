Day 2: Shell Scripting Basics
Objective
To learn the basics of shell scripting, understand how to automate tasks in Linux/Unix environments, and write scripts relevant for DevOps workflows.

Key Topics for Day 2
What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a file containing a series of commands written for the shell (command-line interpreter).
Common shells: Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh, and others.
Creating and Running a Shell Script
Create a script file with .sh extension.
Make it executable: chmod +x script.sh.
Run it: ./script.sh.
Basic Syntax
Shebang: #!/bin/bash (specifies the shell to interpret the script).
Comments: Use # to add comments.
Variables
Assign values: VAR="value".
Access variables: $VAR.
Input and Output
echo "message": Print a message.
read VAR: Accept user input.
Control Structures
if-else: Conditional statements.
for and while: Loops for iteration.
case: Multi-branch conditions.
Basic Commands
File operations: touch, rm, mv, cp.
Directory operations: mkdir, rmdir, cd, ls.
Viewing files: cat, head, tail.
Functions
Define reusable code blocks.
Exit Codes
$?: Check the exit status of the last command (0 for success, non-zero for failure).
Debugging
Use bash -x script.sh to debug a script.

Example 1: Hello World Script
bash
CopyEdit
#!/bin/bash
# A simple Hello World script

echo "Hello, World!"


Example 2: User Input and Conditional Statement
bash
CopyEdit
#!/bin/bash
# Greet the user based on input

echo "Enter your name:"
read NAME
if [ -z "$NAME" ]; then
  echo "No name provided."
else
  echo "Hello, $NAME!"
fi


Example 3: File Operations
bash
CopyEdit
#!/bin/bash
# Create, move, and delete a file

FILE="sample.txt"

# Create a file
touch $FILE
echo "File $FILE created."

# Check if the file exists and move it
if [ -f $FILE ]; then
  mv $FILE /tmp/
  echo "File moved to /tmp/."
else
  echo "File does not exist."
fi


Example 4: Looping Through Files
bash
CopyEdit
#!/bin/bash
# List all files in a directory

echo "Listing all files in the current directory:"
for FILE in *; do
  echo $FILE
done


DevOps-Relevant Example: Automation Script
Restarting a Docker Container
bash
CopyEdit
#!/bin/bash
# Restart a Docker container

CONTAINER_NAME="my_app"

echo "Restarting Docker container: $CONTAINER_NAME"
docker restart $CONTAINER_NAME

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Container restarted successfully!"
else
  echo "Failed to restart the container."
fi


Suggested Tasks for Practice
Write a script to create a backup of a directory.
Automate a task like cleaning up log files older than 7 days.
Create a script to check if a service (e.g., nginx) is running, and start it if not.
