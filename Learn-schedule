Here’s a structured schedule for learning Shell Scripting, organized by weeks and days. This plan builds foundational knowledge and progresses to advanced topics relevant for DevOps and system administration.

Week 1: Shell Scripting Basics
Day 1: Introduction to Shell Scripting
What is a shell script?
Types of shells (Bash, Zsh, etc.)
Setting up a shell scripting environment
First script: Hello World!
Executing scripts with chmod +x
Basic commands: echo, ls, pwd
Day 2: Variables and Input/Output
Defining and accessing variables
System variables vs user-defined variables
Reading user input (read)
Displaying output (echo)
Simple calculator script
Day 3: Control Structures (If-Else)
Conditional statements: if, elif, else
Checking file existence and permissions
Using test and [ ] operators
Writing scripts with simple conditions (e.g., "Is the service running?")
Day 4: Loops
for loops: Iterating over files/directories
while loops: Continuous execution until a condition is met
until loops
Practical examples: Listing files, monitoring logs
Day 5: Functions
Writing reusable functions
Passing arguments to functions
Return values from functions
Script examples: File backups using functions
Day 6: Working with Files and Directories
File operations: touch, rm, mv, cp
Directory operations: mkdir, rmdir, cd
File viewing commands: cat, head, tail
Practical examples: Automating file management
Day 7: Debugging and Optimization
Debugging scripts with bash -x or set -x
Using trap for signal handling
Optimizing script performance
Practice: Debugging a sample script
Week 2: Intermediate Shell Scripting
Day 1: Advanced Variables
Arrays in shell scripting
Associative arrays (Bash 4.0+)
String manipulation: Substring, length, replacement
Example: Managing configurations with arrays
Day 2: Advanced Input/Output
Redirecting input/output (>, >>, <, |)
Using tee to write and display output
File descriptors: Standard input, output, and error
Script examples: Logging script output to a file
Day 3: Working with Processes
Process management: ps, kill, jobs
Background and foreground processes
Monitoring processes with top and htop
Script examples: Automating process restarts
Day 4: Scheduling and Automation
Using cron for periodic tasks
Writing cron jobs for scripts
Automating backups and monitoring
Introduction to at and systemd timers
Day 5: Text Processing
Text search: grep, sed, awk
Extracting and transforming data
Writing reports from logs
Practice: Analyzing logs for specific patterns
Day 6: Networking
Basics of network scripting
Fetching data with curl and wget
Checking connectivity: ping, netcat
Example: Automating server health checks
Day 7: Error Handling and Trapping
Handling errors with $?
Using trap for cleanup
Writing fail-safe scripts
Practice: Writing a robust deployment script
Week 3: Advanced Shell Scripting for DevOps
Day 1: Working with APIs
Making API calls using curl
Parsing JSON responses with jq
Example: Fetching and displaying weather data
Day 2: Git Integration
Automating Git commands with shell scripts
Using git hooks for pre-commit checks
Writing a script for automated deployments
Day 3: Docker Integration
Managing Docker containers with scripts
Automating container builds and restarts
Practical examples: Cleaning up unused images and containers
Day 4: Cloud CLI Automation
Automating AWS CLI commands with shell scripts
Managing Azure resources with az CLI
Example: Automating resource creation and monitoring
Day 5: Security and Access
File permissions: chmod, chown, umask
Secure scripts with restricted access
Writing scripts for user management
Day 6: Backup and Restore
Automating backups of files, databases
Compressing files with tar and gzip
Restoring data from backups
Day 7: Real-World Project
Develop a complete DevOps script:
Backup logs
Clean up old files
Restart services if needed
Send a summary report
Week 4: Final Week – DevOps Project and Mastery
Create a complete project integrating:
Automation (Cron jobs)
Docker container management
Cloud CLI (e.g., Azure, AWS)
Logs analysis and reporting
